# Welcome

Welcome! We are glad you are interested in contributing to the Datadog Terraform module for Google Cloud Run.

## Contributing to code

Any PRs that update generated terraform code will need to be updated through the `autogen_config.json` file. Ask a maintainer for help with this process, as the autogeneration script is not publicly available.
